This project encompasses my learning and implementation process of the Embedded JavaScript (EJS) module.
EJS is a templating engine that allows dynamic content creation using JavaScript code within HTML. In this project,
I demonstrated how to pass data from the server to EJS templates and how to make the page structure dynamic with examples. By using Express.js,
I created a simple routing structure that allows users to access different EJS templates rendered based on specific URLs. Additionally,
I integrated a database (DB), enabling the retrieval of data from the database and its dynamic reflection on the pages.
Through the implementation of fundamental functions such as data processing, page layout, and database interaction with EJS, I reinforced my knowledge of creating dynamic web pages.
